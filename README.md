This repository contains my R scripts for data cleaning, organization, visualization, and analysis (multilevel, logistic modeling, reliability analysis, ANOVA) for the research project, "Exploring the Mechanisms that Underlie the Benefits of Retrieval Practice in Younger and Older Adults" (my Master's Thesis).

# Summary of project

The following provides a summary of the research project. Please see the section below for an explanation of "Recollection" and "Familiarity" parameters under the Dual-Process Signal-Detection Model of recognition memory.

Despite marked reductions in recollection with healthy aging (Jennings & Jacoby, 1997; Naveh-Benjamin, 2000; Koen & Yonelinas, 2016), prior work often reveals a benefit of retrieval practice in older adults that is similar in magnitude to that observed in younger adults (Coane, 2013; Meyer & Logan, 2013). This research seeks to address the puzzle of why older adults exhibit such a robust testing effect, despite declines in the very process often considered to be the central contributor to the testing effect. Does retrieval practice for older adults ameliorate existing deficits in recollection or function primarily via preserved familiarity processing? Do the mechanisms that support the benefits of retrieval change with increasing age?

# Dual-Process Signal-Detection Model Parameters

Recollection is conceptualized as experiential in nature, consisting of conscious memory for material accompanied by the contextual components of the episode in which the material was experienced (Jacoby, 1991; Yonelinas, 2001, 2002). Under the Dual-Process Signal-Detection model, recollection is conceived of as a threshold process (Parks & Yonelinas, 2007). By contrast, familiarity is conceptualized as an automatic, unconscious form of memory for (or “familiarity” with) material, devoid of the contextual or experiential aspects of the episode.  Under the Dual-Process Signal-Detection model, familiarity is conceived of as a signal-detection process.
